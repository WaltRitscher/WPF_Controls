 <Paragraph>The Moon is in

 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Tidal_locking">locked</Hyperlink> in this configuration as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by the Earth.
 <Span>

 <Paragraph>The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains are called

Maria are found almost exclusively on the lunar nearside, with the lunar far side having only a few scattered patches. Only about 2% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria,

 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-3">[5]</Hyperlink></Span> compared to about 31% on the near side.
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-worldbook">[1]</Hyperlink></Span> The most likely explanation for this difference is related to a higher concentration of heat producing elements on the near-side hemisphere, as has been demonstrated by geochemical maps obtained from the

 <Paragraph>The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called <Run FontStyle="italic">terrae</Run>, or more commonly just <Run FontStyle="italic">highlands</Run> since they are topographically higher than most maria. Several prominent mountain ranges on the near side are found along the periphery of the giant impact basins, many of which have been filled by mare basalt. These are believed to be the surviving remnants of the impact basin's outer rims.
 <Span>

 <Paragraph>Using images taken by the

 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Peary_%28crater%29">Peary crater</Hyperlink> at the Moon's north pole remain illuminated for the entire lunar day, at least during the hemisphere's summer season. These unnamed
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Peak_of_Eternal_Light">mountains of eternal light</Hyperlink> are possible because of the Moon's extremely small axial tilt to the ecliptic plane. No similar regions of eternal light were found at the south pole, although the rim of

 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-7">[11]</Hyperlink></Span> Most impact craters formed when asteroids and comets collided with the lunar surface over the first billion or so years, and globally, about half a million craters with diameters greater than 1 km can be found on the lunar surface. Since impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, the number of craters per unit area on a geologic unit can be used to estimate the age of its surface (see
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Crater_counting">crater counting</Hyperlink>). The lack of an atmosphere, weather and recent geological processes ensures that many of these craters have remained relatively well preserved in comparison to those found on Earth.</Paragraph>

<Run>Presence of water</Run></Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>The continuous bombardment of the Moon by
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Comet">comets</Hyperlink> and
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Meteoroid">meteoroids</Hyperlink> have added some amount of water to the lunar surface. Energy from sunlight usually splits much of this water into its constituent elements hydrogen and oxygen, which generally escape to space. Attesting to the dryness of lunar rocks, the samples collected by Apollo astronauts near the equator have been found to contain only traces of water. However, because of the very slight axial tilt of the Moon's spin axis to the ecliptic plane (only 1.5°), some deep craters near the poles never receive any light from the Sun, and are permanently shadowed (see
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Shackleton_%28crater%29">Shackleton crater</Hyperlink>). Thus, any water molecules that eventually ended up in these craters could be stable for long periods of time.</Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>Clementine has mapped craters at the lunar south pole
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-11">[15]</Hyperlink></Span> that are shadowed in this way, and computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km² might be in permanent shadow.
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-M03">[10]</Hyperlink></Span> Results from the
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Clementine_mission">Clementine mission</Hyperlink> bistatic radar experiment are consistent with small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface, and data from the
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Lunar_Prospector">Lunar Prospector</Hyperlink> neutron spectrometer indicate that anomalously high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the upper meter of the regolith near the polar regions.
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-12">[16]</Hyperlink></Span> Estimates for the total quantity of water ice are close to one cubic kilometer. Recently, observations with the
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory">Arecibo</Hyperlink> planetary radar showed that some of the near polar Clementine radar returns might instead be associated with rocks ejected from young craters. If true, this would indicate that the neutron results are primarily from hydrogen in forms other than ice, such as trapped hydrogen molecules or organics. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these data are non unique (ice or surface roughness could give rise to the observed signature), and it appears that these results do not exclude the possibility of water ice in permanently shadowed craters.
 <Span>

 <Paragraph>Water ice can be mined and then split into hydrogen and oxygen by solar panel-equipped electric power stations or a nuclear generator. The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering

 <Paragraph>The Moon is a

 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Mantle_%28geology%29">mantle</Hyperlink>, and
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Planetary_core">core</Hyperlink>. This structure is believed to have resulted from the
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Fractional_crystallization">fractional crystallization</Hyperlink> of a
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Lunar_magma_ocean">magma ocean</Hyperlink> shortly after its formation about 4.5 billion years ago. The energy required to melt the outer portion of the Moon is commonly attributed to a
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis">giant impact</Hyperlink> event that is postulated to have formed the Earth-Moon system, and the subsequent reaccretion of material in Earth orbit. Crystallization of this magma ocean would have given rise to a mafic mantle and a plagioclase-rich crust (see <Run FontStyle="italic">Origin and geologic evolution</Run> below).</Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>Geochemical mapping from orbit implies that the crust of the Moon is largely anorthositic in composition,
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-L06">[18]</Hyperlink></Span> consistent with the magma ocean hypothesis. In terms of elements, the lunar crust is composed primarily of

 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Magnesium">magnesium</Hyperlink>,

 <Paragraph>Partial melting within the mantle of the Moon gave rise to the eruption of mare basalts on the lunar surface. Analyses of these basalts indicate that the mantle is composed predominantly of the minerals
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Olivine">olivine</Hyperlink>,
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Orthopyroxene">orthopyroxene</Hyperlink> and
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Clinopyroxene">clinopyroxene</Hyperlink>, and that the lunar mantle is more iron rich than that of the Earth. Some lunar basalts contain high abundances of titanium (present in the mineral
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Ilmenite">ilmenite</Hyperlink>), suggesting that the mantle is highly heterogeneous in composition. Moonquakes have been found to occur deep within the mantle of the Moon about 1000 km below the surface. These occur with monthly periodicities and are related to tidal stresses caused by the eccentric orbit of the Moon about the Earth. A few shallow moonquakes with hypocenters located about 100 km below the surface have also been detected, but these occur more infrequently and appear to be unrelated to the lunar tides.

 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/South_Pole-Aitken_basin">South Pole-Aitken basin</Hyperlink>, which possesses the lowest elevations of the Moon. The highest elevations are found just to the north-east of this basin, and it has been suggested that this area might represent thick

 <Paragraph>Another distinguishing feature of the Moon's shape is that the elevations are on average about 1.9 km higher on the far side than the near side. If it is assumed that the crust is in
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Isostasy">isostatic equilibrium</Hyperlink>, and that the density of the crust is everywhere the same, then the higher elevations would be associated with a thicker crust. Using gravity, topography and seismic data, the crust is thought to be on average about 50±15 km thick, with the far-side crust being on average thicker than the near side by about 15 km.

 <Paragraph> Radial gravitational anomaly at the surface of the Moon.</Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>The gravitational field of the Moon has been determined by the tracking of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The principle used depends on the
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Doppler_effect">doppler effect</Hyperlink>, whereby the line-of-sight spacecraft acceleration can be measured by small shifts in frequency of the radio signal, and the measurement of the distance from the spacecraft to a station on Earth. Since the gravitational field of the Moon affects the orbit of a spacecraft, it is possible to use these tracking data to invert for gravitational anomalies. However, because of the Moon's
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Synchronous_rotation">synchronous rotation</Hyperlink> it is not possible to track spacecraft much over the limbs of the Moon, and the farside gravity field is thus only poorly characterized.</Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>The major characteristic of the Moon's gravitational field is the presence of
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Mascon">mascons</Hyperlink>, which are large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins. These anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon, and an accurate gravitational model is necessary in the planning of both manned and unmanned missions. They were initially discoved by the analysis of
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter">Lunar Orbiter</Hyperlink> tracking data,
 <Span>
 <Hyperlink TargetName="_note-15">[21]</Hyperlink></Span> since pre-Apollo navigational tests were experiencing landing position errors much larger than mission specifications.</Paragraph>
 <Paragraph>The origin of mascons are in part due to the presence of dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill some of the impact basins. However, lava flows by themselves can not explain the entirety of the gravitional signature, and uplift of the crust-mantle interface is required as well. Based on
 <Hyperlink NavigateUri="/wiki/Lunar_Prospector">Lunar Prospector</Hyperlink> gravitational models, it has been suggested that some mascons exist that do not show evidence for mare basaltic volcanism.
